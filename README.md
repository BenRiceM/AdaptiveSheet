Adaptive Sheet is a SwiftUI framework that offers a new style of modal presentation. 

Adaptive sheets start as a floating card and can expand to become full-size sheets.

Adaptive sheets are implemented using standard sysyem sheet presentation under the hood, so gestures and bindings and layouts all work as youâ€™d expect.
